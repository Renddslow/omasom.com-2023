## Outcomes

As an institution, we are aligned around a series of outcomes against which we measure everything that we do. Our six outcomes define what programs we offer, how we teach, and how we assess our students.

### 1. Ministry Competency

Students will identify the major components of their specialized ministry fields, and create strategies to successfully deploy these components within their ministries. They will obtain a level of competence within their ministry field to be capable of leading and executing said ministry at a professional level.

### 2. Pastoral Leadership

Students will develop skills necessary for leading those in your ministry as a pastoral leader. They will adopt a Biblical model of pastoral leadership, and gain the heart for leading and shepherding people as exemplified throughout the teachings of Scripture.

### 3. Church Leadership and Management

Students will develop a model of biblical leadership that allows them to work well with those they will lead within church ministry. They will assess and deploy best practices informed both Scripture, managerial sciences, and the project management body of knowledge.

### 4. Biblical Literacy

Students will communicate major themes, messages, of the Bible. They will develop a paradigm for reading the Scriptures which sees the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus. They will develop a robust, sound, biblical theology. **Students will read the Bible in its entirety.**

### 5. Discipling Others

Students will facilitate spiritual conversations and lead people to a closer relationship with Jesus. They wil identify spiritual needs through the Holy Spirit and can introduce teaching, training, and spiritual practices from the long history of the Christian tradition. They will develop a sensitivity toward investing in people’s spiritual growth God, regardless of their spiritual maturity.

### 6. Personal Discipleship

Students will rehearse a variety of spiritual disciplines and integrate them into their personal rhythms of spiritual practice. They will craft a rule of life which will help them practice Christian spirituality throughout their ministry. They will articulate the importance of emotional health and self-awareness in the Christian life and especially in ministry. Students will develop a self-awareness of vices and virtues of one’s Christian character which need active correction or development.

### 7. Theological Orthodoxy

Students will develop a strong grounding in Trinitarian doctrine and the essential teachings of the Christian faith. They will understand the historical and theological context of key Christian doctrines, and be able to defend and articulate them clearly and accurately. They will recognize and reject false teaching and heresy, and uphold the authority of the Bible as the inspired, authoritative, and canonical word of God. Students will cultivate a deep love for God and his word, and a commitment to living out the implications of the Christian faith in all aspects of life.
