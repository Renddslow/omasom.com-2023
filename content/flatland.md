## Why Residency?

Omaha School of Ministry believes that the combination of [classroom learning](/academics) and hands-on experience is essential for the growth and development of aspiring ministers. The ministry residency program allows residents to work closely with experienced pastors and gain a deeper understanding of the practical aspects of ministry.

This includes learning how to lead a congregation, how to provide pastoral care, and how to navigate the challenges of ministry in today's world. Through this program, residents will not only gain the skills necessary to be successful in ministry, but they will also have the opportunity to discern their calling and develop their own unique approach to pastoral leadership. We believe this is the key to equip and prepare ministers to be successful and effective in their ministry and to make a positive impact in their communities.
