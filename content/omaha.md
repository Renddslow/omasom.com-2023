Omaha School of Ministry is located in the beautiful city of Omaha, Nebraska. With a population of just under 500,000, Omaha offers many of the attractions and events you would find in a large city, without being overly crowded or busy. Itâ€™s a great mix of a mid size town and a lively downtown experience, making it the perfect place to house our school!
