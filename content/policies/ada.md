title: Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
---

## Definition

1. Per [section 12102](https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/ada/#sec-12102--definition-of-disability) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), the term “disability” in the scope of this policy means, with respect to an individual:
   1. a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of such individual;
   2. a record of such an impairment; or
   3. being regarded as having such an impairment (as described in paragraph (3) of section 12102 of the ADA).

## Policy

1. The School shall provide reasonable adjustments or accommodations necessary to afford equal opportunity and full academic participation in all programs for qualified students with professionally verified disabilities.
2. These adjustments or accommodations will be provided in the most integrated setting appropriate to the student's needs.
3. A copy of the above policy statement (2.A and 2.B) should be included on all course syllabi as part of a statement on student success, learning resources, and/or accommodations.

## Requesting Accommodations

1. Requests for accommodations are always initiated by the student. It is therefore the responsibility of the student to seek accommodations when appropriate.
2. Students needing accommodations are required to file an application applied by the School with the President ahead of each 16-week semester with reasonable lead time so it can be carefully considered and, if approved, appropriate accommodations arranged.
3. To be eligible for disability-related accommodations and services, an individual must have a professionally documented disabling condition as defined by 1.A and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 1990.
4. The professional verification by a licensed professional health care provider who is qualified in the diagnosis of the disability.
   1. For emotional disabilities, the evaluation must be within one year prior to the accommodation request.
   2. For learning disabilities, the evaluation must be within three years prior to the accommodation request.
   3. The verification must include the basis for the diagnosis, the student's present level of functioning of the major life activity affected by disability, and the accommodations needed.
5. The President will evaluate the application and determine what actions are appropriate. The action taken on the application will be communicated to the student. If an accommodation is approved, all relevant personnel will be informed.
   1. Accommodations are considered confidential information under 3.F.ii.1 of the Omaha School of Ministry Ethics Policy.
   2. The President may seek professional consultation from individuals who would either submit to or through professional affiliation fall under the confidential information policy of the School or some other equivalent policy safeguarding confidential information.
6. Accommodations should be sought ahead of each 16-week semester using a reapplication form provided by the School.
