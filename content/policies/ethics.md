1. Diversity
   1. The School believes that humans are created in the Image of God and that God has invited humans of all ethnicities and backgrounds to join him around his heavenly throne (Rev 7:9).

If they were all one part, where would the body be?” (1 Cor 12:18-19). For this reason, the School promotes diversity, inclusion, and respect.
   2. In a God-honoring educational community which has as its end the training of the next generation of Christian ministers, diversity and inclusion are an important means to developing such a community in a healthy way. The School encourages diversity amongst its students, faculty, and staff in order to promote the unity of the bonds of peace (Eph 4:3).
