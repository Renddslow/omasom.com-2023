Omaha School of Ministry believes that humans are created in the Image of God and that God has invited humans of all ethnicities and backgrounds to join him around his heavenly throne (Rev 7:9). Furthermore, within the body of Christ diversity is prized: “God has placed the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be. If they were all one part, where would the body be?” (1 Cor 12:18-19). For this reason, the School promotes diversity, inclusion, and respect.

In a God-honoring educational community which has as its end the training of the next generation of Christian ministers, diversity and inclusion are an important means to developing such a community in a healthy way. OSM encourages diversity amongst its students, faculty, and staff in order to promote the unity of the bonds of peace (Eph 4:3).

OSM promotes diversity of thought and expression as expressed in the Omaha School of Ministry Freedom of Expression Policy.

OSM admits qualified applicants regardless of sex, race, color, national origin, or disability who are personally committed to faith in Jesus Christ.
