## Mission Statement

Omaha School of Ministry exists to produce and equip well-trained, highly qualified ministers to expand the Kingdom of God.

## Institutional Outcomes

1. Ministry Competence: Students will identify the major components of their specialized ministry fields, and create strategies to successfully deploy these components within their ministries. They will obtain a level of competence within their ministry field to be capable of leading and executing said ministry at a professional level.
2. Pastoral Leadership: Students will develop skills necessary for leading those in your ministry as a pastoral leader. They will adopt a Biblical model of pastoral leadership, and gain the heart for leading and shepherding people as exemplified throughout the teachings of Scripture.
3. Church Leadership and Management: Students will develop a model of biblical leadership that allows them to work well with those they will lead within church ministry. They will assess and deploy best practices informed both Scripture, managerial sciences, and the project management body of knowledge.
4. Biblical Literacy: Students will communicate major themes, messages, of the Bible. They will develop a paradigm for reading the Scriptures which sees the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus. They will develop a robust, sound, biblical theology. Students will read the Bible in its entirety.
5. Discipling Others: Students will facilitate spiritual conversations and lead people to a closer relationship with Jesus. They will identify spiritual needs through the Holy Spirit and can introduce teaching, training, and spiritual practices from the long history of the Christian tradition. They will develop a sensitivity toward investing in people’s spiritual growth God, regardless of their spiritual maturity.
6. Personal Discipleship: Students will rehearse a variety of spiritual disciplines and integrate them into their personal rhythms of spiritual practice. They will craft a rule of life which will help them practice Christian spirituality throughout their ministry. They will articulate the importance of emotional health and self-awareness in the Christian life and especially in ministry. Students will develop a self-awareness of vices and virtues of one’s Christian character which need active correction or development.
7. Theological Orthodoxy: Students will develop a strong grounding in Trinitarian doctrine and the essential teachings of the Christian faith. They will understand the historical and theological context of key Christian doctrines, and be able to defend and articulate them clearly and accurately. They will recognize and reject false teaching and heresy, and uphold the authority of the Bible as the inspired, authoritative, and canonical word of God. Students will cultivate a deep love for God and his word, and a commitment to living out the implications of the Christian faith in all aspects of life.

### Attendance

Students are expected to attend and be on time to all classes and course related activities. This includes ministry residence roles and responsibilities. Students must let their ministry mentor and the OSM program director know if they will be absent from any school activities. Planned absences should be communicated as soon as possible (minimum of two weeks in advance) to ministry mentors and the OSM director.

Students who are absent due to an illness for more than two days must submit a note from their doctor or physician excusing them from their responsibilities. Failure to present a note will result in the student being counted as absent or tardy for the following days.

### Tardies/Absences

If a Ministry Residence student is late or absent to any ministry activity, class time, or program responsibility, they will be counted as tardy/absent. Students who are counted as tardy will be subject to a fine of $15 per tardy. Students who are absent will receive a $25 fine. If a student has accrued a combined total of five tardies or absences, the President reserves the right to increase the fine amount.

Cheating is strictly prohibited. Cheating is defined as:

1. Copying from another student’s exam, assignment, or project.
2. Using materials during an exam or for an assignment that are not authorized by the instructor.
3. Using devices during an exam that are not authorized by the instructor.
4. Taking any materials out of the exam room (for example, the exam itself or scratch paper) that the exam instructions prohibit students from taking.
5. Making an electronic copy of part or all of an exam, unless the instructions authorize making a copy.
6. Possessing a copy of an exam or assignment that the student knows or should have known that they are not authorized to have.

This includes, but is not limited to, using sources without citation, submitting someone else’s work as your own, using external materials during assessments or assignments without permission, or resubmitting work you have turned in for another class.

In addition, the use of AI language models and similar technologies is prohibited.

Students should familiarize themselves with proper citation practices and seek guidance from administrative staff or faculty when needed.

Each instructor has the right to further curtail the use of particular sources for all or part of their courses.

### Academic Good Standing

A student’s scholastic standing at Omaha School of Ministry is based upon their cumulative grade point average. A student in the program remains in good standing as long as they maintain a cumulative GPA of 2.0. The first semester in which they drop below a 2.0 GPA or fail 2 or more classes, they will be placed on Academic Probation.

Students on Academic Probation must meet the following conditions to return to good standing:

- Speak with their academic advisor regularly while on probation.
- Complete at least 12 credit hours over a period of one semester.
- Achieve a minimum GPA of 2.0 for that term and a 2.5 for program essentials.
- Seek the approval of the Dean to have their Academic Probation lifted.

Students who continually fail to meet these requirements to return to good academic standing may have their enrollment dropped at the discretion of the Dean and the President.

Students who are on Academic Probation have one semester to work toward improving their academic standing. Maintaining academic probation status over more than one semester will disqualify the student from any scholarships awarded directly by Omaha School of Ministry, but may seek other means of financial aid.

Ministry residence students may not be in private settings or in residences after 1:00 AM with members of the opposite sex (regardless of the number of students) without an adult or member of OSM staff present. An adult here is defined as an individual over the age of 25, who is not in a dating relationship with any of the students present.

Private settings include, but are not limited to:

1. OSM or Flatland campus buildings outside of office or service hours;
2. Homes where one or more students are house sitting;

Failure to comply with this policy will be met with a $50 fine added to the student account of any student present.

### Host Families

Students staying with an OSM provided host family must sign and agree to the “OSM Host Family Agreement” before moving in with their assigned host family. This document will be signed by the student, host family, and OSM president.

Disputes between roommates should be handled primarily by the students. OSM staff are not responsible for mediating disagreements between roommates. However, if a situation arises in which there is a pattern of disrespect, abuse, or a breach of OSM guidelines, staff will step in to resolve the situation. Repeated disrespect may be met with a student being asked to withdraw from OSM. If a student is unable or late in paying their rent consistently (more than once) disciplinary measures may follow (see disciplinary action).

## Ministry Fields

Students will be given roles, responsibilities, and projects to complete throughout the semester pertaining to their ministry field. The goal of each field is to give the student as much experience and insight into their desired ministry fields as possible. Students will not be allowed to switch their fields after the first two weeks of a semester.

### Appeals

If a student wishes to appeal the decision of the President, they may make a written request to the OSM Board of Trustees within 30 days of the suspension email. After which the board of trustees may make a final decision on the appeal request.
